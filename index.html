                1. All the rumors have finally died down and many skeptics have tightened their lips, the iPod does
                support video format now on its fifth generation. While the iPod is not the first to come up with this,
                it has certainly made its stature as the greatest in the market and can be dubbed as the best multimedia
                portable player available.

                else. Video playback capabilities have made it a complete multi media equipment, but not all formats are
                supported just yet. So if you want to put your videos in your iPod you have to make sure that they are
